# booking-and-reservation-engine-web-application

### What is it
The project is a web application that facilitates hotel reservation management.

### 1. Analyze Requirements
My client is a global provider that aims to generate efficient and innovative booking solutions. As the size of the application grew and the number of users increased, different teams were required to constantly modify the code, maintaining the modular structure became difficult and the cost of code modification and maintenance slowly increased. 

Our team was responsible for migrating the booking and reservation engine web application to microservices, dividing the existing functionality into different microservices modules to facilitate subsequent independent development, monitoring and extension to improve the efficiency of booking transactions.
